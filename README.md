# Star specification
Work in progress specs/docs for a programming language I'm making called Star, which is an object-oriented language that takes ideas from Swift, Objective-C, Crystal, Red, and Raku (just to name a few).

Explainations of the random folders you see:
- design: This folder has documents talking about design choices/explainations for Star.
- examples: This folder includes various examples (mostly from Rosetta code) of programs written in Star. Nothing is final.
- syntax: This folder includes formal syntactic specification for Star. Needs updated at some point.
- concepts: This folder contains experimental ideas I've come up with for Star. Nothing is guaranteed to actually be added.

## Where is the compiler?
That's a good question. Make one and I'll tell you if one exists. Joking aside, I only have the parser partially done, and I don't feel like it's ready to be open source yet.

## Everything here seems really informal
Yeah I'm 16.

## Why should I care about *another* object-oriented language?
I'm not saying you have to, but the goal of Star is to try new things that better-known languages like JS and Python are unwilling to do.

## Anything else?
Feel free to suggest ideas! I don't have all the creativity in the world, so if you come up with an idea just say something about it.
