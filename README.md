# Star specification
Work in progress specs/docs for a programming language I'm making called Star, which is an object-oriented language that takes ideas from Swift, Objective-C, Crystal, Red, and Raku (just to name a few).

Explainations of the random folders you see:
- design: This folder has documents talking about design choices/explainations for Star.
- examples: This folder includes various examples (mostly from Rosetta code) of programs written in Star. Nothing is final.
- syntax: This folder includes formal syntactic specification for Star.
- concepts: This folder contains experimental ideas I've come up with for Star. Nothing is guaranteed to actually be added.

## What's the goal of Star?
I have many goals for Star, but I guess the big one right now is to make every part of the language *consistant*, which is something that very few languages have actually achieved (e.g. Go, Smalltalk). To me, consistency makes it much easier to learn and use a language since you don't have to remember all of the "exceptions" in the language's grammar (e.g. Perl, C).

## Where is the compiler?
That's a good question. Make one and I'll tell you if one exists. Joking aside, I only have the parser partially done, and I don't feel like it's ready to be open source yet.

## Everything here seems really informal
Yeah I'm 16.

## Anything else?
Feel free to suggest ideas! I don't have all the creativity in the world, so if you come up with an idea just say something about it.
